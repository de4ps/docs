# Cross-chain Swap/Send via Skip

## Introduction

This short tutorial will guide you through the process of cross-network swapping or token transferring on the HAQQ Network using Keplr and the Skip API.

:::note Information from the Haqq Team
The Haqq team is actively working on integrating cross-chain swap/send functionality into the HAQQ Wallet. Stay tuned for updates.

:::note About Skip
Skip Go API is an end-to-end interoperability platform enabling developers to create seamless cross-chain experiences for users by integrating a variety of underlying DEXes and cross-chain messaging protocols, including IBC, CCTP, Hyperlane, and Axelar. Skipâ€™s mission is to make cross-chain interoperability easy for both developers and their users!
:::

Skip products, such as the Skip API, are used by various projects, including Noble Chain - [Noble Express Transfer](https://express.noble.xyz/transfer). In this tutorial, we will use the official Skip interface - [Skip GO](https://go.skip.build).

## Preparation

:::note September 2024 Update
Skip now requires a Noble blockchain address. This is due to the fact that transfers go through the centralized CIRCLE bridge, which mints tokens on the Noble blockchain, followed by IBC transfers to the HAQQ Network. This address serves as a backup in case the IBC transfer does not reach the target network.

:::danger
Recipient addresses MUST be your personal wallets, not the addresses of exchanges! 
:::

1. [Install Keplr](/user-guides/connect-your-wallet/Keplr/) and add both the Noble and HAQQ networks.
2. Obtain a wallet address in Bech32 format on the HAQQ network.
3. Obtain a wallet address on the Noble network.

:::tip Obtaining a Bech32 Address in HAQQ Wallet
In the HAQQ Wallet, you can retrieve your wallet address in both EVM and Bech32 formats (the latter is used in Cosmos networks). To do this, click the three dots next to your wallet address and select "Copy Bech32 Address."

:::tip Obtaining a Bech32 Address on HAQQ via EVM Address
If you have the recipient's address in EVM format on the HAQQ Network, you can convert it to a Bech32 address using the web app for vesting. Visit this URL: https://vesting.haqq.network/account/0xYOUR_EVM_ADDRESS (e.g., https://vesting.haqq.network/account/0x887fa9cd8427ef96afb5376a60ceb8904514bbe9) and copy the address starting with "haqq1...."

9. Set the backup address using Keplr. This will be your wallet address on the Noble network, where the transferred funds will be sent in case of any issues.
10. Review the operation one more time. If everything is correct, click "Submit."
11. Skip will request permission to deduct the amount you wish to transfer. Verify the amount and confirm the operation.
